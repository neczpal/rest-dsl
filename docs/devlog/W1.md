# Week 1 Progress: 

- Getting to know ANTLR:
  - https://www.antlr.org
- Setting up a basic lexer - parser
- Ideation of my Rest-DSL's core concepts:
  - Separate resources and actions - a service can support both
    - Resources: (GET, PUT etc.) CRUD support (== NOUNS e.g: "/pet")
      - Add possibility to customization
        - what is the key when "/pet/{key}"
        - readonly fields (cannot be updated)
        - writeonly fields (cannot be read once created)
      - Or which operations is supported
        - create one (POST /pet)
        - find by id (GET /pet/1)
        - list all (GET /pet)
        - update whole (PUT /pet/1)
        - update partly (PATCH /pet/1)
        - delete one (DELETE /pet/1) 
    - Actions: defaults to POSTs (== VERBS e.g:"/buy")
      - customization
        - change http method
        - body / query params?
- Researching other designs: OAS and Smithy
  - https://smithy.io/2.0/index.html
  - https://swagger.io/specification/

## TODO:

- Support endpoints in dsl
- Create tests for input - output
- Create parser for server(java) - client(java) - oas structure
- Support model extension
- Support model inheritance
- Support macros for making a resource "CRUD"
